GoogleCloudMessageExample
=========================

The easiest GoogleCloudMessage example I found. Based on example code, with server-part in php

Just set the AuthorizationKey in the Server-PHP File and
the sender-id in the MainActivity Java File. Both information can be found in the developer console (console.developers.google.com)
